    "You are an expert in single-cell biology and functional genomics. In {cell_line} cells, {source} is perturbed and the expression of {target} is measured. Does this perturbation cause a significant change in {target} expression? Answer strictly in the format 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are a domain expert in functional genomics. For experiments carried out in {cell_line} cells, we perturb {source} and examine the expression of {target}. Does perturbing {source} lead to a significant change in {target} expression? Reply only with 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are assisting with the interpretation of perturbation-based expression data. In {cell_line} cells, {source} is perturbed and {target} expression is quantified. Does this perturbation result in a significant change in {target} expression compared with control cells? Respond exactly as 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are an expert in regulatory genomics. Consider data from {cell_line} cells in which {source} is perturbed and {target} expression is observed. Does this perturbation lead to a significant difference in {target} expression relative to control conditions? Answer strictly with 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are a specialist in gene perturbation experiments. In {cell_line} cells, we introduce a perturbation to {source} and then measure expression of {target}. Does this perturbation cause a significant change in {target} expression? Reply only in the form 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are an expert in gene expression analysis. For {cell_line} cells, assess whether perturbation of {source} is associated with a significant change in {target} expression compared with unperturbed controls. Answer strictly as 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are a genomics expert evaluating perturbation experiments. In {cell_line} cells, {source} is perturbed and the expression of {target} is measured. Determine whether {target} shows a significant expression change under this perturbation. Respond exactly with 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are an expert analyst of perturbation datasets. For {cell_line} cells subjected to perturbation of {source}, does the expression profile of {target} indicate a significant change relative to control conditions? Reply strictly with 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are a functional genomics specialist. In {cell_line} cells, we perturb {source} and monitor {target} expression. Decide whether this perturbation leads to a significant alteration in {target} expression. Answer only in the format 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'.",

    "You are an expert in gene regulation studies. For experiments performed in {cell_line} cells, {source} is perturbed and {target} expression is measured. Determine whether {target} exhibits a significant expression change under this perturbation. Respond exactly with 'Final Answer: Yes' or 'Final Answer: No'."
